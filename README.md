## üßë‚Äçüíª Development

- All main code is in /src:
  - /app: Next.js app structure (public, admin, API routes)
  - /components: Shared, UI, form, and AI components
  - /lib: Utility functions, hooks, helpers
  - /constants: Type-safe routes, API paths, enums
  - /types: Centralized TypeScript types/interfaces
  - /prisma: Prisma schema & migrations

- Code style:
  - Run ```npm run lint``` and ```npm run format``` before pushing.
  ESLint + Prettier + TypeScript strict everywhere.

## ü§ñ AI Assistant (How it works)

- Activate AI panel in the form editor (admin only)
- Choose fields (or whole form) to give context
- Ask in English (or use fast-commands):
- ‚ÄúAdd a required phone field‚Äù, ‚ÄúSuggest better labels‚Äù, ‚ÄúRefactor for school students‚Äù, etc.
- AI returns actions (add, update, delete) and suggestions in strict JSON format
- Safe patching ‚Äî only allowed fields are modified, full undo supported
- All chat history is session-scoped (can be stored in DB)

## üõ°Ô∏è Security

- JWT session tokens, server-side validation
- Strong password requirements, account protection
- All API routes strictly typed, input/output Zod-validated

## üöÄ Deployment

- Ready for Vercel, Docker, or any Node/Next-compatible host 
- Use environment variables for all keys and secrets
- For production: enable HTTPS, set proper CORS, and secure your email/AI providers

## ‚òë TODO
1. [ ] Validate all fields requirements before publish (Puck editor)
2. [ ] Revalidate all TS in project
